# Acceptance

Completion-contract authority. A task is not DONE because a builder says it is
done. A task is DONE when its frozen contract here has sufficient evidence.

Every criterion answers one question:

> What must be demonstrated before this work is allowed to become DONE?

`TASKS.md` records which contract governs a task. This file records what the
contract requires. Where the two disagree, this file wins.

## Criterion identity

Identifiers are stable and never reused:

```text
AC-<task>-<nn>      a single criterion          AC-T-P2-02-03
AC-<task>           the task's whole contract   AC-T-P2-02
AC-GLOBAL-<name>    an inherited contract       AC-GLOBAL-DETERMINISM
```

Renumbering a criterion breaks its evidence. Retire a criterion by marking it
`WITHDRAWN` through an Acceptance Change Request; do not delete it.

## Criterion structure

Prefer observable behaviour over implementation description:

```text
Given <precondition>
When  <action>
Then  <observable outcome>
```

Each criterion carries one evidence class and one state.

## Evidence classes

| Class | Satisfied by |
| --- | --- |
| `TEST` | An automated test that fails when the behaviour regresses. |
| `MUTATION` | A deliberate break that the test suite catches. |
| `INSPECTION` | A recorded reading of a document, diff, or generated artifact. |
| `RUNTIME` | Observed behaviour of the running system. |
| `MANUAL` | A named human performing and reporting a procedure. |

`MANUAL` evidence is the only class that may support `HUMAN_VERIFIED`
validation, and only a named human may record it.

## Criterion states

```text
PASS      evidence exists and holds
FAIL      evidence exists and contradicts the criterion
NOT_RUN   no evidence yet
```

A task may not be `DONE` while any mandatory criterion is `FAIL` or `NOT_RUN`.

## Inherited contracts

Some requirements apply to a class of work rather than one task. Record each one
once as an `AC-GLOBAL-<name>` contract. Inheriting tasks name it and must not
restate it.

None yet.

## Reviewer findings

A finding blocks completion only when classified as:

```text
ACCEPTANCE_FAILURE
INVARIANT_VIOLATION
REGRESSION
MISSING_EVIDENCE
```

The following are recorded but do not block `DONE`:

```text
RISK
MAINTAINABILITY
ARCHITECTURE_PREFERENCE
STYLE
FUTURE_IMPROVEMENT
```

Reviewer preference does not create a new acceptance criterion. A reviewer who
believes the contract is wrong raises an Acceptance Change Request.

## Frozen contracts

A contract freezes when its task moves to `WIP`. From that point neither builder
nor reviewer may reinterpret it. A required change becomes an Acceptance Change
Request recording:

```text
Task
Criterion
Current contract
Proposed contract
Reason
Impact
Decision
```

Until a request is explicitly accepted, the existing criterion remains
authoritative. Accepted requests are appended to the log below and the criterion
is edited in place with its request identifier noted.

## Acceptance Change Requests

None.

# Contracts

No contracts yet. A task gains one when it is created.
