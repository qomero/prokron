"""Where Prokron keeps its files.

Everything Prokron owns lives inside one directory, so installing it into a
repository adds one entry to that repository's root rather than five (ADR-024).
The separation between authored authority and compiled output that ADR-014
established is unchanged: it is now two subdirectories instead of two
directories at the root.

Paths a host reads by fixed address — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`.claude/commands/`, `.opencode/commands/`, `.agents/skills/prokron/` — are not
listed here. Prokron does not choose them.
