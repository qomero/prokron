# Prokron product thesis

This document explains why Prokron is shaped the way it is. The
[README](../README.md) shows what it does; the [specification](SPEC.md) defines
the records and the working lifecycle. This is the reasoning between them.

It is written in two layers. Layer 1 is the argument, in plain language, and
needs no knowledge of the tool. Layer 2 is how the argument turns into a
deterministic compiler over Markdown.

Every claim here is labelled:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Implemented** | Shipped, tested, and demonstrable with a command in this repository |
| **Designed** | Specified in an internal working document; no code exists yet |
| **Thesis** | A position this project holds, not a capability it claims |

# Layer 1 — Why a project needs its own memory

## The practical problem

Work on software now moves between participants constantly: session to session,
model to model, person to agent, branch to branch. Each move loses something
that was never written down.

A concrete version. Claude implements part of `T-31` and the session ends. A
week later Codex opens the same repository. Without a shared record, Codex has
to rediscover what `T-31` means, why it exists, what was already tried, which
dependency actually mattered, which decision was made along the way, and what
is still unfinished. The diff shows what changed. It does not show what was
intended, what was rejected, or what would make the work acceptable.

A human joining in March faces exactly the same wall, with the same workarounds:
read the commits, ask someone, or redo a decision that was already settled.

## Why "AI memory" is the wrong frame

Most answers to this reach for agent memory: give the assistant a longer
context, a vector store, a summary of the last conversation.

That helps one agent. It does not help the reviewer, the next agent, or the
teammate. Memory attached to a participant leaves the project in the same
position every time that participant changes — and now the project has several
private versions of its own history, none of them authoritative.

The question worth asking is different:

> Not *what should this agent remember*, but **what should the project
> remember**.

**Thesis.** Project context should belong to the project, not to any individual
human, model, agent, or session.

Most of a conversation is not worth keeping. What is worth keeping is the set of
consequences a conversation produced: a decision, a reversal, a dependency
discovered, work completed, work abandoned, evidence gathered, a stopping point.
Those outlive the session that produced them, and everyone needs them.

## One project, two interfaces

A person and an agent want the same facts in different shapes.

A person wants to look: current phase, what is in flight, what is blocked, what
was decided recently, how much of this is actually verified. A browsable page.

An agent wants to parse: this task, its dependencies and whether they are
satisfied, its acceptance criteria and their states, the decisions that govern
it, the handoff. A structured packet.

```text
                    PROJECT STATE
                          │
             ┌────────────┴────────────┐
             ▼                         ▼
      Human projection          Agent projection
      HTML dashboard            context packet, JSON
             │                         │
             ▼                         ▼
          Humans                    Agents
```

**Implemented.** `prokron dashboard` writes the first. `prokron context <task>`
writes the second. Both are computed from the same compiled project, by the same
deterministic code, with no model in the loop.

**Thesis.** A project meeting and an AI coding session should not require two
different versions of the project. When the dashboard and the packet can
disagree, someone has to reconcile them by hand, and that person becomes the
real source of truth.

## Where governance comes in, and how little of it there is

The word is worth avoiding until the mechanism is visible, because most of what
it suggests is not here. Prokron has no roles, no approvals, no workflow engine,
no permissions.

What it does have, once the records exist, is a small set of properties that
together make disagreement resolvable:

- decisions are explicit, dated, and superseded rather than rewritten;
- dependencies are declared, so "what can start" is computed rather than argued;
- completion has conditions agreed before the work starts, not after;
- evidence is recorded against the criterion it satisfies;
- when two participants disagree, a stated order decides which authority wins;
- no single participant owns the context.

That is the whole of it. It is lightweight on purpose: a heavier process would
be abandoned, and an abandoned record is worse than none, because people still
trust it.

## What Prokron is not

**Thesis, and a boundary the implementation respects.**

> Prokron owns project understanding, not project execution.

It is not an issue tracker for AI, not an engineering manager, not an autonomous
project manager, not an agent framework, not a model router, not an IDE. It
schedules nothing, assigns nothing, and runs nothing. Agents and people execute;
Prokron keeps the record that lets them know where they are.

A useful test: if a feature would decide *what happens next on its own*, it does
not belong here. If it helps a participant understand what is already true, it
might.

# Layer 2 — How the model works

## Authored records, generated views

**Implemented.** There are exactly two kinds of file.

`.prokron/chronicle/` is authored — by people, by agents, by hand. It is the only
source of truth. `.prokron/compiled/` is generated and disposable: delete the
whole directory, run `prokron compile`, and every file comes back byte for byte.

The separation is the point. A generated view can never answer a question that an
authored document answers, so a stale summary cannot outrank the record it was
derived from. It also means the compiler never edits authority — it reads the
chronicle and writes only the compiled directory.

## A deterministic compiler, not a reasoning system

**Implemented.** The compiler is standard-library Python. No dependencies, no
network, no model provider. The same documents produce identical output every
time.

This is a deliberate division of labour. Language models are good at reading a
messy repository and proposing structure; they are bad at being the same twice.
So the model does the semantic work — writing the task, drafting the contract,
recording the decision — and a deterministic harness does the state work:
resolving dependencies, computing what is ready, deciding which gates block which
phase exits, counting what is actually verified.

If the numbers on the dashboard came from a model, two readers could get two
answers, and the shared state would be a shared guess.

## The records, and the questions they answer

**Implemented.** Each record exists because a project keeps being asked one
question.

| Record | Question it answers | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `PHASES.md` | What maturity stage are we in, and what must be true to leave it? | Phases with outcome, entry, exit, exit authority; gates recorded once and referenced |
| `TASKS.md` | What work exists, and what must happen first? | Tasks with phase, dependencies, status, validation, evidence, governing decisions |
| `ACCEPTANCE.md` | What counts as done? | One contract per task; criteria as Given/When/Then, each with an evidence class and a state |
| `ADR/` | Why did we choose this? | One file per decision, append-only, superseded rather than edited |
| `INTENT.md` | What is being attempted right now? | Zero or one task, at its exact stopping point |
| `HANDOFF.md` | What does the next participant need? | Overwritten each checkpoint |
| `JOURNAL.md` | What happened, and what was left mid-air? | Append-only, no authority |

Two of those are worth dwelling on.

### Acceptance is a contract, and it freezes

**Implemented.** A task is `DONE` when every mandatory criterion of its contract
holds and its evidence is recorded — not when someone says so.

The contract freezes the moment the task starts. That single rule is what stops
the most common failure in reviewed work: quietly moving the bar to match what
was built. Changing a frozen contract takes an Acceptance Change Request, which
is a visible act. A reviewer's preference is not an acceptance criterion.

Completion and confidence are also kept apart. A task can be `DONE` and
`UNTESTED`. `HUMAN_VERIFIED` can only be recorded by a named human, against
manual evidence. Marking something finished and believing it is solid are
different claims, and collapsing them is how a project ends up confident about
nothing in particular.

### Decisions accumulate; they do not get rewritten

**Implemented.** An ADR is appended when a material choice is made, accepted, or
acted on. Changing your mind produces a new ADR that supersedes the old one, and
the old one stays. A reader following the chain sees not just the current rule
but the reason it replaced the previous one — which is usually the thing a
newcomer actually needs.

## Making disagreement decidable

**Implemented.** Two competent reviewers will disagree. The goal is not to
prevent that; it is to make the disagreement resolvable without seniority
deciding it. Prokron ships an explicit order:

```text
1. Product and domain authority
2. The explicit acceptance contract
3. Invariants
4. Accepted decisions in ADR/
5. Reproducible tests and evidence
6. Existing code convention
7. Reviewer preference
```

This has been exercised, not just written down. Two coding agents audited the
same implementation against the same contract. They disagreed on one criterion;
one of them was right, and the disagreement was settled at level 5 by rendering
both variants and looking. The record of that sits in this repository's own
acceptance evidence.

## Evidence, and what code cannot tell you

**Thesis, partly implemented.**

Code shows that something exists. It cannot tell you why it exists, whether it is
still wanted, whether it satisfies the requirement it was written for, or whether
anyone considers it finished. A document has the opposite problem: it describes
what was intended, which the implementation may have quietly left behind.

So these are different things and a project record should not merge them:

```text
WHAT EXISTS  ≠  WHAT WAS INTENDED  ≠  WHAT IS CURRENTLY INTENDED
```

**Implemented today**, the distinction is narrow and concrete: evidence is
recorded against the specific criterion it satisfies, carries a class
(`TEST`, `MUTATION`, `INSPECTION`, `RUNTIME`, `MANUAL`), and is separate from the
validation strength of the task as a whole. The specification states that when a
product document and the chronicle disagree, the agent surfaces and reconciles
the difference rather than choosing silently.

**Designed, not built:** a fuller ladder that separates raw evidence from an
extracted claim, an interpretation, a candidate state and canonical state — so a
project can be adopted from messy existing material without anything becoming
canonical until a human confirms it. That belongs to a later phase and no command
implements it.

## Entry: how a project gets in

**Implemented.** There are exactly two entry modes.

A **new project** starts from a product specification: the agent and the
developer resolve ambiguity, then write the first phases, tasks, dependencies and
contracts before implementation begins.

An **existing project** starts empty, deliberately. Prokron does not scan the
repository and infer past tasks, decisions or intent, because an inferred history
is indistinguishable from a recorded one once it is written down, and it would be
trusted. The chronicle records from now on. Historical reconstruction happens
only if a developer explicitly asks for it.

**Designed, not built.** Meeting projects that arrive in other conditions — an
idea with no repository yet, or a long-running codebase whose documentation is
scattered, stale and contradictory — is specified in an internal working
document. The principle it follows is that the project should not have to
reorganize itself before Prokron can read it, and that nothing extracted from
messy evidence becomes canonical without human confirmation. None of it ships
today.

## What this repository proves about itself

**Implemented.** Prokron tracks its own development in its own chronicle, which
is the only claim here that can be checked without installing anything. Its
dashboard reports one red gate and an unfinished task, because that is true.

**Not proven.** Whether agent hosts reliably maintain the chronicle across real
multi-session work is still being measured. The rules ask an agent to checkpoint
before a handoff, a compaction, a session end, or an approaching limit — but they
are instructions, a host may not honour them, and Prokron cannot read a quota
counter it is not shown. That is why the continuity gate is red rather than
quietly green.
